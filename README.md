Hi, I'm a Junior Front End Developer (React.JS). This project is a test task for the position of Trinne Angular, during this project, I got acquainted with Agular, because up to this point I had absolutely no experience.
During development, a stopwatch application was written in the format (MM:SS) with a number of control buttons:
1. Start - starts the stopwatch.
2. Stop - stops the stopwatch, resets the value to 0
3. Wait - Double tap pauses the stopwatch.
4. Restart - Resets the timer to 0 and automatically starts a new countdown
